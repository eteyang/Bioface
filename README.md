# Bioface

Similar to the matlab implementation, the code can be run by just ruinning MainBioface.py. To specificy the dataset, the image and mask directory need to be set in dataset.py. The code is in an extremeley rough state right now although it should be functional on a CPU (haven't tested if it can use a GPU properley).
